### Instructions for use ###

You have three options for downloading the course material found on this page:  

1.  You can download the materials by clicking on each link.  

2.  You can "clone" repository, using the buttons found to the right side of your browser window as you view this repository.  This is the button labelled "Clone in Desktop".  If you do not have a git client installed on your system, you will need to [get one here](https://git-scm.com/download/gui) and also to make sure that [git is installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
